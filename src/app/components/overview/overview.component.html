                The NewWorld Game is a platform, a work- and play-space, for discovery and developing
                    solutions to real-world problems— and getting those solutions implemented. Its goal is to have
                    real impact—to change the world— by providing you and millions of other like-minded creative
                    individuals with space and tools for developing solutions to the problem and issues about which
                    you care. It is a place that focuses your creativity, experience, values, and perspective on
                    problems and issues that matter— and provides you a set of tools, and how to use them, that
                    lead to new paths of action and impact— to strategic designs, plans, and solutions that are
                    viable, regenerative, inclusive, resilient, and cost-effective— and that get implemented. That it
                    is also fun, helps.
               </p>
            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">The NewWorld Game’s name draws on its history as being a direct descendent and outgrowth
                of the original World Game that was inspired by and based on the work and vision of
                Buckminster Fuller. It’s developers worked with Fuller on the first iterations of the World Game.
                It points to the need for a new world, one that not only replaces the old world, but makes new
                options and solutions that engender new possibilities for everyone. The NewWorld Game does
                this by empowering you with ways of developing new options for a better future that works for
                all life on Earth, not just those with large quantities of money and the delusion of thinking they
                are in control.</p>

            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
                The NewWorld Game (NWG) takes technological advancements of the 21 st century and
                    creatively couples them with the design science engine that was used to play the original World
                    Game “longhand” in the month-long World Game workshops and shorter in-person and online
                    Global Solutions Labs. It couples an easy-to-use interface with AI, an empowered methodology
                    for developing real-world solutions, comprehensive world statistical resources, solution
                    libraries, and a community of problem solvers. It builds and leverages the power of a diverse,
                    collaborative, cross-cultural, multi-disciplinary, and intergenerational global community with
                    linkages to real organizations implementing solutions.

            <h3 class="my-4 text-xl font-bold leading-tight text-gray-900 lg:mb-6 lg:text-xl dark:text-white">2. Your Role</h3>
            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
                Your role, and challenge, in the NewWorld Game is to develop solutions to global and local problems. 
                You win (we all win) when your solution gets through the Peer Review process and enters the NewWorld Tournament and is added to the NewWorld Solutions Library. 
                Ideally, you develop your solution as part of a team, but it is possible to play the NewWorld Game alone. The fact that you are here is important. On several levels— for the world, for you, and for the community you will be a part of as you work together on what you care about. Thank you.
