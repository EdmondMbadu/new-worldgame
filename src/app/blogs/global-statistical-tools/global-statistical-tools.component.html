                        Accurate statistics on the state of the world are indispensable for dealing with the problems of
                        the world. They are the foundation of NewWorld Game and the development of solutions and

                    Accurate, verifiable, up-to-date statistics from reliable, trustworthy sources serve as the
                    foundation upon which governments, international organizations, corporations, communities,
                    policymakers, researchers, and activists base their decisions, strategies, and interventions.
                    Without good global statistics, solutions to problems such as poverty, hunger, climate change,
                    health care, and education will be misguided and inefficient at best— while solutions that contain
                    misinformation, conspiracy theory, whimsey, or wishful thinking are not just counter-productive,
                    they perpetuate the divisions of a fractured world and the problems we face.
               </p>
               <p class="text-md mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white ">
                Reliable statistics enable the identification of problem areas and the extent, depth, and impacts of
                the problem, tracking of progress over time, and assessment of the effectiveness of solutions,
                policies and programs. They also foster transparency, accountability, and public trust, by
                providing a clear picture of where the world stands in its pursuit of sustainable development
                goals and solving the world’s problems. In essence, accurate statistics are not just numbers—they
                are a crucial tool for informed decision-making, strategic planning, and ultimately, making a
                tangible difference in solving the world&#39;s most pressing problems.

                                        The Committee for Development Policy (CDP), a subsidiary body of the
                                    Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), advises the Council on a wide
                                    range of issues that are relevant for the implementation of the 2030
                                    Agenda for Sustainable Development. The CDP uses three criteria to

                                    identify countries as least developed and reviews the list of LDCs every
                                    three years. Official data used in these triennial reviews of the LDC
                                    category since 2000 can be downloaded in Excel format.
                                    The CDP Secretariat has also produced time series estimates of the LDC
                                    criteria providing information of countries’ progress towards the LDC
                                    criteria from 2000 onwards. The dataset differs from the official triennial
                                    review dataset due to data revisions, changes in data sources,
                                    methodological changes and most notable, changes in composition of the
                                    composite indices HAI and EVI.
                                    The CDP decided in 2020 to enhance the graduation framework by
                                    introducing a set of supplementary graduation indicators (SGIs). These
                                    indicators describe vulnerabilities not fully captured by the LDC criteria and other factors relevant for graduation. The SGI dataset, including a
                                    visualization of the latest available data can be downloaded. More
                                    information on the dataset can be found in the explanatory note.

    &quot;Better data leads to better models&quot; is the motto of Facets, a toolkit for
    &quot;understanding and analyzing machine learning datasets.&quot; Facets offers
    two powerful data visualization tools. The first, Overview, gives users a
    quick visual analysis of the distribution of values across the features of
    one or more datasets. Overview provides users with summary statistics
    that give the general shape of each feature of their dataset and may help
    identify issues like unexpected values, missing values for a large number
    of observations, training/serving skew, and train/test/validation skew.
    The second tool, Dive, is an interactive interface for exploring large
    numbers of data points at once. Dive visualizes the relationships between
    data points across all different features of a dataset and allows a data
    point to be bucketed in multiple dimensions. The tool can help users
    identify classifier failure, systematic errors, and potential new signals for
    ranking. Facets is an open-source software toolkit developed by the
