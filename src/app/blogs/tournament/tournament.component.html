                 <span class="font-bold">The NewWorld Tournament</span>.is an exciting option for all players/designers in the
                 NewWorld Game. It is a way your solution can move from “game” to the real

               <h1 class="text-xl my-4 font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Here's how:</h1>
            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">There are a series of Tournaments in the NewWorld Game. Many of
                them will be focused on different topics. Some will be general. Winners will
                receive monetary Awards that are used to take their solution towards
                implementation in the real world. For some solutions that could involve developing
                a prototype “proof of concept” for their solution, or a key part of the solution. For
                some other solutions it could involve further study into impacts and benefits. And
                for a few, the Award will be enough to begin implementation. The Award funds
                whatever is needed to make your solution more compelling, implementable, real.

                    The path to the Tournament is straight forward. First you develop your solution.
Then your Team’s solution is evaluated. During the evaluation process a randomly
chosen group of NewWorld Game players (and sometimes outside-the-game
experts) goes over your solution and provides feedback on ways to improve and
strengthen your solution. Their role is to be a part of your Team, to help you
develop the most compelling strategy ever. Plus, they give your solution a
numerical score of 1 to 10 in the following areas:
                </p>
            <ul class="list-disc mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
                <li> <span class="font-bold">Technological feasibility — </span>does your solution use current technology (no
                    magic wands) </li>
               <li><span class="font-bold">Ecologically positive - </span> does it do no harm, preserve, or better, regenerate
                the environment (destroying the environment is no solution)</li>
                <li><span class="font-bold">Economic — </span>is it affordable, is there a reasonable source for funding the
                    strategy (no Santa Claus)</li>
                <li> <span class="font-bold">Equitable - </span> is it fair, just, builds social cohesion, reduces wealth disparities
                    (no subsidies to billionaires, fossil fuels, etc.)</li>
                <li> <span class="font-bold">Achieves the Preferred State - </span>  does it achieve the Preferred State, using the technology, programs, policies, funding, etc. described.</li>
           
                <li>  <span class="font-bold">Understandable</span> — is it straight-forward, organized so it can be understood
                    by a high school student (and if you are a HS student—by your parents)</li>
              </ul>

                After this feedback and score from the Evaluator Team you have the option of
                taking your strategy to the next level by incorporating what you learned in the
                Evaluation process that you feel strengthens your solution. Then you submit your
                improved solution to the Evaluation Team again. When your strategy has an
                average score of 9.0 from at least 3 of the Evaluators, it is eligible to be submitted
                to the NewWorld Tournament. It will also be added to the <a class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600 underline" target="_blank" href="https://designsciencelab.com/global-solutions-database/">Global Solutions

            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
                The larger the monetary award the sooner real
                world implementation can happen. It is our intention to have as many Tournaments
                each year as possible. The number of Tournaments and the size of the monetary
                prize are dependent on funders. When NWG began we funded the Tournament
                from the $250 tuition payments received from participants in the Global Solutions
                Lab. We will continue doing this, but we want to do more. Towards that end, we
                invite you— and/or your corporation, foundation, school, organization,
                government agency, personal fortune— to make a tax-deductible donation to the NewWorld
                Tournament Fund. If it is sizable enough, your contribution could fund its own
                Tournament, focused on the topic/SDG of your choosing. If this is appealing or
                you want further information, contact us at <a target="_blank" href="mailto:{{email}}" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-600" >{{email}}</a>
