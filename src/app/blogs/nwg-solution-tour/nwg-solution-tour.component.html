          <h1 class="text-xl my-4 font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Step I. Defining the Problem State </h1>
          
               <h1 class="text-md my-4 font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">What are the symptoms of this problem? How do you measure it? </h1>
            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">The problem we chose is getting electricity to all the health clinics in Africa.  Health and healthcare are compromised when there is no, inadequate, or unreliable access to electricity. Electricity is required for the proper function of medical equipment, refrigerator storage for vaccines, and air circulation systems. Without reliable and safe electricity, services like childbirth, emergency care, and vaccinations cannot be confidently provided at local healthcare facilities. 

                Getting electricity to all the health clinics in Africa will have profound impacts on infant and maternal mortality, life expectancy, quality of life, and economic productivity. 
                
                
            </p>
            <h1 class="text-md my-4 font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">What is the problem you have chosen and why is it important? </h1>
            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white"> In 2018, only 40% of health facilities in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) had access to electricity2. Of those, just 28% have had reliable access—with power being unavailable for up to 540 hours per year across the entire region2. A few leading causes of low electricity access include inequitable distribution across Africa, inadequate buy-in from local and federal governments, and poor infrastructure. 
            </p>

Countries in North Africa, as well as Gabon, South Africa, and outlying islands have high access rates. Landlocked countries and those with expansive rural areas experience lower energy access3.</figcaption>
                </figure>
            
        
            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
                In SSA, there are large disparities between urban and rural areas in per capita consumption of energy. Those residing in cities most often have better access to reliable, affordable, and modern forms of energy compared to those in rural areas. North African countries and South Africa experience the highest rates of electricity access (Figure 1), with more than 99% of the population having access in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt and 94% of the population having access in South Africa. Countries with more rural areas, such as Niger, Chad, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and South Sudan have greatly lower electricity access rates (Figure 1). The average person living in SSA consumes as little as 200 kWh/year of electricity2. In North African countries and South Africa, the average electricity use per person is 1,442 kWh/year and 4,148 kWh/year, respectively2. In rural areas of SSA, electricity use can be as low as 50 kWh/year per person, just enough to charge a mobile phone and power minimal lighting for a few hours a day2. 

                Almost 50% of African countries do not have an officially approved electrification plan4. Energy access is a complicated goal to achieve, as access alone cannot be a stand-alone objective. Countries need to be looking to achieve a productive use of electrification4. Oftentimes, and especially in rural areas, this requires investment in other infrastructure at the same time as energy and electricity. This makes energy investment even more expensive, labor intensive, and time consuming for governments. The countries in Africa that have produced an electrification plan have reported success in improving their national electricity access rates, attributing this to a thought-out strategy that addresses institutional, technical, and financial aspects of electrification3. Nevertheless, at the midpoint of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals, 600 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa are without access to electricity5.

                Strategy
                To address the need for electricity in the healthcare sector, the government, private sector, and healthcare facilities need to implement energy systems that stimulate investment, integration of technology, and holistic community well-being and growth. The strategy proposed here focuses on cost-effective, phased developments that grow with a community’s identified needs and capacities.

                There are many electrification projects that occur across Africa that supply a large amount of energy over one or two project phases. These projects may over (or under) estimate the amount of electricity needed by a community, as areas in rural Africa do not have many devices requiring electrification (since it is not often available). However, the healthcare facility would obtain—and benefit from—such devices if electricity is available. Focusing on supplying small amounts of electricity in phases to communities will facilitate greater change across Africa, faster, in a way in-tune with economic development and needs, and in a more cost-effective manner.

                A sustainable strategy that supplies clean, not fossil-fuel based, electricity would begin with targeting communities with identified needs, existing healthcare infrastructure, and appropriate geographic conditions for solar systems. The strategy builds upon and partners with one or more Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in the surrounding areas, leverages current infrastructure, and develops additional opportunities for local residents and business owners. The strategy will be tailored to the characteristics of the operating areas in order to provide the best results for each partner community. The strategy focuses on solar energy providing electricity to healthcare facilities, although the general idea and principles can be used with wind, hydropower, and other green electric systems. The strategy, the Solar Growth System (SGS), has five stages: Community Assessment, Stand Alone Systems, Micro-Grids, Mini-Grids, and Distribution.

            <h1 class="text-md my-4 font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Community Assessment</h1>
            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
                <!-- <span class="font-bold">Community Assessment<br> </span> -->

                The Community Assessment stage (Stage One) requires the implementing entity—whether it be a large NGO, the local or federal government, an international organization, a self-organized community, or healthcare facility—to complete a full evaluation of the target healthcare facility and community. This would include but is not limited to understanding current energy systems and access, current and future energy needs of the community, current infrastructure, community leadership and access to capital, and where necessary, the politics of the area. 
                    
                    Developing an energy system that can provide a rural African health facility with enough electricity to power the needs of 100 hospital beds, heavy duty lighting, and hundreds of electric medical devices might be a good goal but is not in line with the current medical infrastructure of a typical rural clinic in SSA. Clinics in rural SSA are often open-air, have few electric devices, capacity for just tens of patients, and only a few medical staff. Clinics in different geographical areas may serve different quantities of people and some may currently have some energy access—which needs to be evaluated for integrity, reliability, affordability, and safety. Technology and material availability needs to be assessed, taking stock of where parts can be sourced and ensuring local businesses will benefit. Sophisticated parts (for large solar systems) will most likely not be immediately available locally, but the community assessment stage will assess the business environment for its ability to grow to procure and sell these parts and materials. After taking into account these characteristics, the implementing organization will be able to confidently develop a successful electrification plan for the healthcare facility and surrounding community. 
                    
                    <span class="font-bold">Stand-Alone Solar System<br> </span>
                    
                    Stage Two (Figure 4) of the Solar Growth System (SGS) is to construct a stand-alone solar system for the clinic for whom the Community Assessment has been done. After considering the current and anticipated energy needs and aligning these with available funds, the first modular system is built. It could consist of just one solar panel on the ground, one battery, and a simple control system. When the clinic’s energy needs grow or it secures more funds (or both), the health care facility can begin to upgrade their solar system. By adding one or two solar panels, followed by more batteries and upgrading the control system, the system will grow to accommodate greater energy needs while becoming more sophisticated. The SGS strategy considers systems under 1 kW, or three 380 W solar panels, to be stand-alone systems. During this stage, the clinic will be able to power handheld devices, or up to 60 light bulbs for a period of a day7.

                The implementing organization will provide technical support and training to the clinic staff on how to set up and maintain their Solar Growth System. Eventually, the system’s technical requirements (regarding maintenance and safety) will grow to be greater than the clinic staff can support. At this point, theimplementing organization will provide technical support to the Stage Two communities. It will provide training to the needed number of local community members to maintain the system. Once trained, the new “Solar Mechanics'' will be supported financially by the clinic (funded by their own revenue sources, government, or private funding).

                <span class="font-bold">Micro-Grid <br> </span>
                As the clinic’s energy needs grow, they will continue to upgrade their Solar Growth System (SGS) at their own pace (dependent on their energy needs and funds).

            <li>
                <span class="font-bold">How much will it cost to test, for a proof-of-concept?<br> </span>
                A stand-alone system will cost $1,000-$3,000 USD. A mini-grid will cost approximately $50,000, including the solar panels. </li>
           <li> 
            <span class="font-bold">How much will our strategy cost to implement at scale? <br> </span>
            Assuming there are 1,000 clinics that need electricity, the total cost (assuming a stand-alone system cost is $2,000) will be $2 million US.
 

            Electrifying all the communities that surround ach of those 1,000 clinics will cost approximately $50 million.
            
            
            
            The cost of the stand-alone, micro-grid, and mini-grid systems are $2.61, $2.38, and $2.15 USD per watt respectively (see below for details). The cost measures what it takes to implement the system compared to how much energy is being produced. In the United States, the average cost per watt of a solar system in 2023 is $2.95 USD9. This cost is before rebates and incentives and includes installation costs. The costs of the SGS do not include installation estimates.
            
            
            
            The cost of solar panels, and therefore solar systems, are decreasing (Figure 8). The cost of the three stages (stand-alone, micro- and mini-grid) included in the SGS were calculated using figures (as many as possible) from African countries, mostly South Africa. This gives a more accurate estimate of the cost of implementing the SGS in Africa, represented in US Dollars. The costs will vary from country to country, depending on the economic climate and availability of solar resources.  
            
            
            
            In the United States, if electricity is sold back to the grid, consumers can expect a profit of $0.10-$0.30 USD per kWh sold12. Applying this to the Solar Growth System, if the healthcare facility sells 10,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity, or 10 kWh to 1,000 beneficiaries, they will generate enough revenue to repay a loan for a stand-alone system ($1,000-$3,000 USD). By selling 100,000 kWh of electricity (100 kWh to 1,000 beneficiaries), the clinic will generate enough revenue to purchase all of the technology needed to upgrade a micro-grid to a mini-grid ($30,000 USD), with the exception of solar panels (which will cost $23,100 USD for 70 panels, see Appendix A).  </li>

<br> <span class="font-bold italic">Strategic Summary<br> </span>

Health and healthcare are compromised when there is no, inadequate, or unreliable access to electricity. Electricity is required for the proper function of medical equipment, refrigerator storage for vaccines, and air circulation systems. Without reliable and safe electricity, services like childbirth, emergency care, and vaccinations cannot be confidently provided at local healthcare facilities1. In Sub-Saharan Africa only 40% of the healthcare facilities have access to electricity2. This lack of electrification mirrors the availability of electricity in Africa’s general population. The nearly 600 million people without electricity in Africa are nearly all located where health clinics are not electrified3,4. The strategy in this report presents a design and plan for not just electrifying all the health facilities of Africa, but the surrounding homes, shops, schools, and other non-electrified parts of Africa. It does this through a modular, phased implementation of solar panels and control systems connecting the surrounding community.
