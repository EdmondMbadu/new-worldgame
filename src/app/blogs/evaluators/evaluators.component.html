                A critical part of NewWorld Game is the <span class="font-bold">Evaluator</span>. As an Evaluator you become
                    part of the Design Team that develops the solution. Your evaluation and comments
                    are essential for improving the solution so it will be implemented in the real world.
                    The following is a guide for what you are to do:
                    <span class="font-bold">Your role</span> as an Evaluator is to look over the strategy that has been submitted and,
                    as best you can, come up with ways for improving it, making it stronger, and more
                    likely to get implemented in the real world.

               <h1 class="text-xl my-4 font-bold text-gray-900 dark:text-white">Numerical Evaluations— Sliders</h1>
            <p class="mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">NewWorld Game has a set of measures that are used to evaluate a solution. These
                include the following:

            <ul class="list-disc mb-2 text-gray-900 dark:text-white">
                <li>Does the solution <span class="font-bold">achieve the Preferred State</span> </li>
               <li> Is it <span class="font-bold">technologically feasible</span> — does the solution use current technology (no
                magic wands)</li>
                <li>Is it  <span class="font-bold">ecologically positive</span> — does it do no harm, preserve, or better,
                    regenerate the environment (destroying the environment is no solution)</li>
                <li> <span class="font-bold">Economical</span> — is it affordable, is there a reasonable source for funding the
                    strategy (no Santa Claus)</li>
                <li> <span class="font-bold">Equitable</span>  — is it fair, just, builds social cohesion, reduces wealth disparities
                    (no subsidies to billionaires)</li>
                <li>  <span class="font-bold">Understandable</span> — is it straight-forward, organized so it can be understood
                    by a high school student (and if you are a HS student—by your parents)</li>
              </ul>

                Each of the above has a sliding scale of 1 to 10. Move the slider to the number you
                think is an accurate representation of where the solution is relative to the
                evaluation criteria. (1 = no, not viable; 5 = could be, but needs work: 10 = yes,
                let’s do it, now)

                This quantitative scoring system is very important. But more important is your
                qualitative feedback and suggestions for improvements to the solution. You add
                these in the “Comment” windows. If you put in a low score for a solution on any
                criteria there is a good reason for it. Put that/those reason(s) in the Comments. The
                designers who developed the solution will use your comments to improve their
                solution—and re-submit it to be evaluated again. When it reaches a certain
                numerical level, it is eligible to be submitted to the NewWorld Tournament.)
