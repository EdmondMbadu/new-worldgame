                    A critical part of NewWorld Game is the <span class="font-bold">Evaluator</span>. As an Evaluator you become
                    part of the Design Team that develops the solution. Your evaluation and comments
                    are essential for improving the solution so it can be implemented in the real world.

                On a more personal level, your role as an evaluator enables you to learn and
                develop a critical skill for living in a world of great complexity— of innumerable
                options plus misinformation, inaccuracies, misleading claims and conclusions, and
                inadequate evidence. By evaluating other team’s solutions, you develop and
                practice responsible discernment— an essential skill for making important
                decisions in our complicated world. You, and your diversity of perspectives,
                knowledge and skills, are also vital to the development of viable solutions.

            as best you can, come up with ways for improving it, making it stronger, and more
            likely to get implemented in the real world. There are two forms of evaluation that

                    regenerate the environment (destroying the environment is no solution)</li>
                <li> <span class="font-bold">Economical</span> — is it affordable, is there a reasonable source for funding the
                    strategy (no Santa Claus)</li>
                <li> <span class="font-bold">Equitable</span>  — is it fair, just, builds social cohesion, reduces wealth disparities
                    (no subsidies to billionaires)</li>

                Each of the above has a sliding scale of 1 to 10. Move the slider to the number you
                think is an accurate representation of where the solution is relative to the
                evaluation criteria. (1 = no, not viable; 5 = could be, but needs work: 10 = yes,

                This quantitative scoring system is very important. But more important is your
                qualitative feedback and suggestions for improvements to the solution. You add

                criteria there is a good reason for it. Put that/those reason(s) in the Comments. The
                designers who developed the solution will use your comments to improve their
                solution—and re-submit it to be evaluated again. When it reaches a high enough
