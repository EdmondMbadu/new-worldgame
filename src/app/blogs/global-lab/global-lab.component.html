        <strong>Electrifying Health Clinics in Democratic Republic of Congo</strong><br />
        The first NewWorld Tournament award went to a team in the D.R. Congo who used the award to electrify a village
        health clinic (where 60% of the health clinics don't have electricity). It is serving as a proof-of-concept for
        their solution. Next steps include scaling their solution to meet health clinic electricity needs for the rest
        of the country.
