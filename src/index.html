          <h2>Who Is Buckminster Fuller?</h2>
          <p>R. Buckminster Fuller (1895-1983) was an American architect, systems theorist, author, designer, inventor, and futurist. He developed numerous inventions, mainly architectural designs, and popularized the widely known geodesic dome. Fuller was also the creator of the original World Game, a simulation meant to solve global problems by optimizing the use of Earth's resources.</p>
          <p>His philosophy centered on doing more with less (ephemeralization) and his famous question: How do we make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone?</p>
