NewWorld Game platform is a work- and play-space, for discovery and developing solutions to real-world problems—and getting those solutions implemented. Its goal is to have real impact—to change the world—by providing you and millions of other like-minded creative individuals with space and tools for developing solutions to the problem and issues about which you care. It is a place that focuses your creativity, experience, values, and perspective on problems and issues that matter—and provides you a set of tools, and how to use them, that lead to new paths of action and impact—to strategic designs, plans, and solutions that are viable, regenerative, inclusive, resilient, and cost-effective—and that get implemented. That it is also fun, helps.",

Its developers worked with Fuller on the first iterations of the World Game. It points to the need for a new world, one that not only replaces the old world, but makes new options and solutions that engender new possibilities for everyone. The NewWorld Game does this by empowering you with ways of developing new options for a better future that works for all life on Earth, not just those with large quantities of money and the delusion of thinking they are in control.",
